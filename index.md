  <h2>🔹 About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I'm <strong>Abdelrahman Diknash</strong> — a cybersecurity analyst driven by a deep passion for digital defense, real-world investigation, and the constant evolution of threats.
    I thrive in the blue team domain, where every log, alert, or anomaly could be a puzzle worth solving.
  </p>

  <p>
    From memory dumps to SIEM dashboards, I enjoy diving into the noise to find the signal — uncovering patterns, detecting intrusions, and building smarter defenses.
    My journey started with curiosity about how things break, and evolved into a mission to understand how to protect them better.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I’m working as a SOC Level 2 Analyst at <strong>Orange Jordan</strong>, where I:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain and tune SIEM/SOAR platforms for accurate detection and automated response</li>
    <li>Perform real-time alert triage, malware analysis, and forensic investigation</li>
    <li>Develop playbooks and scripts to streamline SOC workflows and reduce analyst fatigue</li>
    <li>Hunt for threats proactively, not just reactively</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    What drives me isn’t just catching attackers — it's understanding their techniques, building resilient systems, and helping others grow into defenders themselves.
    Whether it’s through CTFs, labs, or writing technical breakdowns, I’m always learning, always building, and always sharing.
